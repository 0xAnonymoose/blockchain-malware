# blockchain-malware Project

## Motivation

It was once common to manually use Anti-virus to verify that new programs obtained from untrusted sources did not contain known malicious code that would damage, steal or destroy our data.

In a modern secure computing environment such as Windows or Mac OSX, advances to process isolation and sandboxing technology as well as real-time scanners keep end-users safe.

The Blockchain is a computing environment that runs untrusted code and holds some of the most important data of all: digital assets.

Why are cryptocurrency users not similarly protected?

## Solution

This project aims to gather, classify and create signatures to identify on-chain malware.

It's sister project `blockchain-scanner` aims to implement both a real-time (transaction-based) and on-demand (contract-based) malware scanning using these signatures.
